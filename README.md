Welcome! This was made for the purpose of asking my boyfriend out for Valentine's Day.

Steps:
1. Navigate to the directory you would like to clone the repo in. In your terminal, type ```git clone https://github.com/reebxu459/valentineuwu.git```
2. In your terminal, type ```cd valentineuwu``` to navigate to the ```valentineuwu``` directory.
3. In your terminal, type ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all dependencies (just streamlit)
4. In your terminal, type ```streamlit run app.py```
Enjoy!
